## Inspiration
Writing **Brainrot terms** is not an easy task, and recognizing them is even more difficult, especially when you're with your buddies or online and one of them pulls out a Brainrot term. In those moments, you can feel left out, guilty for not learning the language, and disconnected from the conversation.

This issue, often overlooked in formal education and course syllabus, inspired us to create **BrainRotLang**‚Äîa platform that bridges the gap for those struggling to grasp the Brainrot language. Our mission is to ensure no one feels left out, enabling people regardless of their age to understand, learn, and thrive in their social circles confidently.

## Challenges We Ran Into
Building **BrainRotLang** came with its share of hurdles, as we tackled both technical and conceptual challenges:

### Finding Relatable Brainrot Terms
One of the biggest challenges was curating a list of Brainrot terms that were not only relevant but also relatable to users. We had to ensure the dataset fed into the language learning model (LLM) covered a wide range of scenarios and contexts while remaining accurate and engaging. Extensive research, brainstorming, and feedback loops were required to refine the dataset.

### Connecting Frontend and Backend with WebSockets
Real-time interaction was a critical feature for our platform, especially for the AI-powered chatbot. Implementing **WebSockets** to enable seamless communication between the frontend and backend proved to be complex. We had to troubleshoot issues such as connection stability, handling multiple users simultaneously, and optimizing data transmission speed.

## Accomplishments That We Are Proud Of
